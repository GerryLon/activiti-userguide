[[bpmnDefiningProcess]]


=== 定义流程 Defining a process


[NOTE]
====
这个介绍的写作，基于使用link:$$http://eclipse.org/$$[Eclipse IDE]创建与编辑文件，但只有很少的部分是Eclipse的特性。可以使用你喜欢的任何其他工具创建包含BPMN 2.0的XML文件。

====

创建一个新的XML文件（__在任意项目上右击，选择New->Other->XML-XML File__）并命名。确保该文件名**以.bpmn20.xml或.bpmn结尾**，因为只有这样，引擎才会在部署时选择这个文件。

BPMN 2.0概要（schema）的根元素（root element）是++definitions++元素。在这个元素中，可以定义多个流程定义（然而我们建议在每个文件中，只有一个流程定义。这样可以简化已部署流程的管理）。下面显示的是一个空流程定义。请注意++definitions++元素最少需要包含++xmlns++与++targetNamespace++声明。++targetNamespace++可以为空，用于对流程定义进行分类。

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<definitions
  xmlns="http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/20100524/MODEL"
  xmlns:activiti="http://activiti.org/bpmn"
  targetNamespace="Examples">

  <process id="myProcess" name="My First Process">
    ..
  </process>

</definitions>
----

BPMN 2.0 XML概要，除了使用Eclipse中的XML分类配置，也可以使用在线概要。

[source,xml,linenums]
----
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/20100524/MODEL
                    http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/20100501/BPMN20.xsd
----


++process++元素有两个属性：

*  *id*: **必填**属性，映射为Activiti ++ProcessDefinition++对象的**key**参数。可以使用++RuntimeService++中的++startProcessInstanceByKey++方法，使用++id++来启动这个流程定义的新流程实例。这个方法总会使用流程定义的**最后部署版本**。

[source,java,linenums]
----
ProcessInstance processInstance = runtimeService.startProcessInstanceByKey("myProcess");
----

* 请注意这与调用++startProcessInstanceById++方法不同。++startProcessInstanceById++方法的参数为Activiti引擎在部署时生成的字符串id，可以通过调用++processDefinition.getId()++方法获取。生成id的格式为**'key:version'**，长度**限制为64字符**。如果有++ActivitiException++显示生成id过长，请限制流程__key__参数（即这个id字段）的文字长度。
* *name*: **可选**属性，映射为++ProcessDefinition++的__name__参数。引擎自己不会使用这个参数，可以用于例如，在用户界面上显示更用户友好的名字。


[[10minutetutorial]]


=== 准备：十分钟教程 Getting started: 10 minute tutorial

这个章节包含了一个（很简单的）业务流程，用于介绍一些基本的Activiti概念，以及Activiti API。


[[bpmn10MinuteTutorialPrerequisites]]


==== 先决条件 Prerequisites

这个教程假设你已经<<demo.setup.one.minute.version,运行了Activiti演示配置>>，并使用独立的H2服务器。编辑++db.properties++并设置++jdbc.url=jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost/activiti++，然后按照link:$$http://www.h2database.com/html/tutorial.html#using_server$$[H2文档]的介绍运行独立服务器。


[[bpmn10MinuteTutorialGoal]]


==== 目标 Goal

这个教程的目标是学习Activiti以及BPMN 2.0的一些基础概念。最后成果是一个简单的Java SE程序，部署了一个流程定义，并通过Activiti引擎API与流程进行交互。当然，在这个教程里学到的东西，也可以基于你的业务流程，用于构建你自己的web应用程序。


[[bpmnFirstExampleUseCase]]


==== 用例 Use case

用例很直接：有一个公司，叫做BPMCorp。在BPMCorp中，每月需要为投资人撰写一份金融报告，由会计部门负责。在报告完成后，需要上层经理中的一位进行审核，然后才能发给所有投资人。

[[bpmnFirstExampleDiagram]]


==== 流程图 Process diagram

上面描述的业务流程，可以使用<<activitiDesigner,Activiti Designer>>可视地画出。但是在这个教程里，我们自己写XML，这样可以学习更多。这个流程的图形化BPMN 2.0注记像是这样：

image::images/financial.report.example.diagram.png[align="center"]

我们看到的是一个<<bpmnNoneStartEvent,空启动事件 none Start Event>>（左边的圆圈），接下来是两个<<bpmnUserTask,用户任务 User Tasks>>：__'Write monthly financial report（撰写每月金融报告）'__与__'Verify monthly financial report（审核每月金融报告）'__。最后是<<bpmnNoneEndEvent,空结束事件 none end event>>（右边的粗线条圆圈）。

[[bpmnFirstExampleXml]]


==== XML表现 XML representation

这个业务流程的XML版本（__FinancialReportProcess.bpmn20.xml__）像下面显示的一样。很容易认出流程的主要元素（点击链接可以跳转到BPMN 2.0结构的详细章节）：

* The <<bpmnNoneStartEvent,(none) start event>> tells us what the _entry point_ to the process is.
* The <<bpmnUserTask,User Tasks>> declarations are the representation of the human tasks of our process. Note that the first task is assigned to the _accountancy_ group, while the second task is assigned to the _management_ group. See <<bpmnUserTaskAssignment,the section on user task assignment>> for more information on how users and groups can be assigned to user tasks.
* The process ends when the <<bpmnNoneEndEvent,none end event>> is reached.
* The elements are connected with each other through <<bpmnSequenceFlow,sequence flows>>. These sequence flows have a +source+ and +target+, defining the _direction_ of the sequence flow.

[[bpmnFirstExamplStartProcess]]


==== Starting a process instance

We have now created the *process definition* of our business process. From such a process definition, we can create *process instances*. In this case, one process instance would match with the creation and verification of a single financial report for a particular month. All the process instances share the same process definition.

To be able to create process instances from a given process definition, we must first *deploy* this process definition. Deploying a process definition means two things:

* The process definition will be stored in the persistent datastore that is configured for your Activiti engine. So by deploying our business process, we make sure that the engine will find the process definition after an engine reboot.
* The BPMN 2.0 process file will be parsed to an in-memory object model that can be manipulated through the Activiti API.

More information on deployment can be found <<chDeployment,in the dedicated section on deployment>>.

As described in that section, deployment can happen in several ways. One way is through the API as follows. Note that all interaction with the Activiti engine happens through its _services_.

[source,java,linenums]
----
Deployment deployment = repositoryService.createDeployment()
  .addClasspathResource("FinancialReportProcess.bpmn20.xml")
  .deploy();
----

Now we can start a new process instance using  the +id+ we defined in the process definition (see process element in the XML file). Note that this +id+ in Activiti terminology is called the *key*.

[source,java,linenums]
----
ProcessInstance processInstance = runtimeService.startProcessInstanceByKey("financialReport");
----

This will create a process instance that will first go through the start event. After the start event, it follows all the outgoing sequence flows (only one in this case) and the first task ('write monthly financial report') is reached. The Activiti engine will now store a task in the persistent database. At this point, the user or group assignments attached to the task are resolved and also stored in the database. It's important to note that the Activiti engine will continue process execution steps until it reaches a _wait state_, such as the user task. At such a wait state, the current state of the process instance is stored in the database. It remains in that state until a user decides to complete their task. At that point, the engine will continue until it reaches a new wait state or the end of the process. When the engine reboots or crashes in the meantime, the state of the process is safe and well in the database.

After the task is created, the +startProcessInstanceByKey+ method will return since the user task activity is a _wait state_. In this case, the task is assigned to a group, which means that every member of the group is a *candidate* to perform the task.

We can now throw this all together and create a simple Java program. Create a new  Eclipse project and add the Activiti jars and dependencies to its classpath  (these can be found in the _libs_ folder of the Activiti distribution). Before we can call the Activiti services, we must first construct a +ProcessEngine+ that gives us access to the services. Here we use the _'standalone'_ configuration, which constructs a +ProcessEngine+ that uses the database also used in the demo setup.

You can download the process definition XML link:$$images/FinancialReportProcess.bpmn20.xml$$[here]. This file contains the XML as shown above, but also contains the necessary BPMN  <<generatingProcessDiagram,diagram interchange information>> to visualize the process in the Activiti tools.

[source,java,linenums]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {

  // Create Activiti process engine
  ProcessEngine processEngine = ProcessEngineConfiguration
    .createStandaloneProcessEngineConfiguration()
    .buildProcessEngine();

  // Get Activiti services
  RepositoryService repositoryService = processEngine.getRepositoryService();
  RuntimeService runtimeService = processEngine.getRuntimeService();

  // Deploy the process definition
  repositoryService.createDeployment()
    .addClasspathResource("FinancialReportProcess.bpmn20.xml")
    .deploy();

  // Start a process instance
  runtimeService.startProcessInstanceByKey("financialReport");
}
----


[[bpmnFirstExampleCandidateList]]


==== Task lists


We can now retrieve this task through the +TaskService+ by adding the following logic:

[source,java,linenums]
----
List<Task> tasks = taskService.createTaskQuery().taskCandidateUser("kermit").list();
----

Note that the user we pass to this operation needs to be a member of  the _accountancy_ group, since that was declared in the process definition:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<potentialOwner>
  <resourceAssignmentExpression>
    <formalExpression>accountancy</formalExpression>
  </resourceAssignmentExpression>
</potentialOwner>
----

We could also use the task query API to get the same results using the name of the group. We can now add the following logic to our code:

[source,java,linenums]
----
TaskService taskService = processEngine.getTaskService();
List<Task> tasks = taskService.createTaskQuery().taskCandidateGroup("accountancy").list();
----

Since we've configured our +ProcessEngine+ to use the same database as the demo setup is using, we can now log into link:$$http://localhost:8080/activiti-explorer/$$[Activiti Explorer]. By default, no user is in the _accountancy_ group. Login with kermit/kermit, click Groups and then "Create group". Then click Users and add the group to fozzie. Now login with fozzie/fozzie, and we will find  that we can start our business process after selecting the _Processes_ page and clicking on the _'Start Process'_ link in the _'Actions'_ column corresponding to the _'Monthly financial report'_ process.

image::images/bpmn.financial.report.example.start.process.png[align="center"]

As explained, the process will execute up to the first user task. Since we're logged in as kermit, we can see that there is a new candidate task available for him after we've started a process instance. Select the _Tasks_ page to view this new task.  Note that even if the process was started by someone else, the task would still be visible as a candidate task to everyone in the accountancy group.


image::images/bpmn.financial.report.example.task.assigned.png[align="center"]

[[bpmnFirstExampleClaimTask]]


==== Claiming the task

An accountant now needs to *claim the task*. By claiming the task, the specific user will become the *assignee* of the task and the task will disappear from every task list of the other members of the accountancy group. Claiming a task is programmatically done as follows:

[source,java,linenums]
----
taskService.claim(task.getId(), "fozzie");
----

The task is now in the *personal task list of the one that claimed the task*.

[source,java,linenums]
----
List<Task> tasks = taskService.createTaskQuery().taskAssignee("fozzie").list();
----

In the Activiti Explorer UI, clicking the _claim_ button will call the same operation. The task will now move to the personal task list of the logged on user. You also see that the assignee of the task changed to the current logged in user.

image::images/bpmn.financial.report.example.claim.task.png[align="center"]



[[bpmnFirstExampleCompleteTask]]


==== Completing the task

The accountant can now start working on the financial report. Once the report is finished, he can *complete the task*, which means that all work for that task is done.

[source,java,linenums]
----
taskService.complete(task.getId());
----

For the Activiti engine, this is an external signal that the process instance execution must be continued. The task itself is removed from the runtime data. The single outgoing transition out of the task is followed, moving the execution to the second task (__'verification of the report'__).  The same mechanism as described for the first task will now be used to assign the second task, with the small difference that the task will be assigned to the  __management__ group.

In the demo setup, completing the task is done by clicking the _complete_ button in the task list. Since Fozzie isn't an accountant, we need to log out of the Activiti Explorer and login in as _kermit_ (who is a manager). The second task is now visible in the unassigned task lists.


[[bpmnFirstExampleEndingProcess]]


==== Ending the process

The verification task can be retrieved and claimed in exactly the same way as before. Completing this second task will move process execution to the end event, which finishes the process instance. The process instance and all related runtime execution data are removed from the datastore.

When you log into Activiti Explorer you can verify this, since no records will be  found in the table where the process executions are stored.

image::images/bpmn.financial.report.example.process.ended.png[align="center"]

Programmatically, you can also verify that the process is ended using the +historyService+

[source,java,linenums]
----
HistoryService historyService = processEngine.getHistoryService();
HistoricProcessInstance historicProcessInstance =
historyService.createHistoricProcessInstanceQuery().processInstanceId(procId).singleResult();
System.out.println("Process instance end time: " + historicProcessInstance.getEndTime());
----

[[bpmnFirstExampleCode]]


==== Code overview

Combine all the snippets from previous sections, and you should have something like this (this code takes in account that you probably will have started a few process instances through the Activiti Explorer UI. As such, it always retrieves a list of tasks instead of one task, so it always works):

[source,java,linenums]
----
public class TenMinuteTutorial {

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // Create Activiti process engine
    ProcessEngine processEngine = ProcessEngineConfiguration
      .createStandaloneProcessEngineConfiguration()
      .buildProcessEngine();

    // Get Activiti services
    RepositoryService repositoryService = processEngine.getRepositoryService();
    RuntimeService runtimeService = processEngine.getRuntimeService();

    // Deploy the process definition
    repositoryService.createDeployment()
      .addClasspathResource("FinancialReportProcess.bpmn20.xml")
      .deploy();

    // Start a process instance
    String procId = runtimeService.startProcessInstanceByKey("financialReport").getId();

    // Get the first task
    TaskService taskService = processEngine.getTaskService();
    List<Task> tasks = taskService.createTaskQuery().taskCandidateGroup("accountancy").list();
    for (Task task : tasks) {
      System.out.println("Following task is available for accountancy group: " + task.getName());

      // claim it
      taskService.claim(task.getId(), "fozzie");
    }

    // Verify Fozzie can now retrieve the task
    tasks = taskService.createTaskQuery().taskAssignee("fozzie").list();
    for (Task task : tasks) {
      System.out.println("Task for fozzie: " + task.getName());

      // Complete the task
      taskService.complete(task.getId());
    }

    System.out.println("Number of tasks for fozzie: "
            + taskService.createTaskQuery().taskAssignee("fozzie").count());

    // Retrieve and claim the second task
    tasks = taskService.createTaskQuery().taskCandidateGroup("management").list();
    for (Task task : tasks) {
      System.out.println("Following task is available for management group: " + task.getName());
      taskService.claim(task.getId(), "kermit");
    }

    // Completing the second task ends the process
    for (Task task : tasks) {
      taskService.complete(task.getId());
    }

    // verify that the process is actually finished
    HistoryService historyService = processEngine.getHistoryService();
    HistoricProcessInstance historicProcessInstance =
      historyService.createHistoricProcessInstanceQuery().processInstanceId(procId).singleResult();
    System.out.println("Process instance end time: " + historicProcessInstance.getEndTime());
  }

}
----


[[bpmnFirstExampleFutureEnhancements]]


==== Future enhancements


It's easy to see that this business process is too simple to be usable in reality. However, as you are going through the BPMN 2.0 constructs available in Activiti, you will be able to enhance the business process by:


* defining *gateways* that act as decisions. This way, a manager could reject the financial report which would recreate the task for the accountant.
* declaring and using *variables*, such that we can store or reference the report so that it can be visualized in the form.
* defining a *service task* at the end of the process that will send the report to every shareholder.
* etc.
