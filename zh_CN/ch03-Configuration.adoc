=== 创建ProcessEngine


Activiti流程引擎通过名为++activiti.cfg.xml++的XML文件进行配置。请注意这种方式与<<springintegration,使用Spring创建流程引擎>>**不**一样。

获取++ProcessEngine++，最简单的方式是使用++org.activiti.engine.ProcessEngines++类：

[source,java,linenums]
----
ProcessEngine processEngine = ProcessEngines.getDefaultProcessEngine()
----

这样会从classpath寻找++activiti.cfg.xml++，并用这个文件中的配置构造引擎。下面的代码展示了一个配置的例子。后续章节会对配置参数进行详细介绍。

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans   http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

  <bean id="processEngineConfiguration" class="org.activiti.engine.impl.cfg.StandaloneProcessEngineConfiguration">

    <property name="jdbcUrl" value="jdbc:h2:mem:activiti;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=1000" />
    <property name="jdbcDriver" value="org.h2.Driver" />
    <property name="jdbcUsername" value="sa" />
    <property name="jdbcPassword" value="" />

    <property name="databaseSchemaUpdate" value="true" />

    <property name="jobExecutorActivate" value="false" />
    <property name="asyncExecutorEnabled" value="true" />
    <property name="asyncExecutorActivate" value="false" />

    <property name="mailServerHost" value="mail.my-corp.com" />
    <property name="mailServerPort" value="5025" />
  </bean>

</beans>
----

请注意这个配置XML文件实际上是一个Spring配置文件。**但这并不意味着Activiti只能用于Spring环境！**我们只是简单利用Spring内部的解析与依赖注入功能来构造引擎。

也可以通过编程方式使用配置文件，来构造ProcessEngineConfiguration对象。也可以使用不同的bean id(例如第3行)。

[source,java,linenums]
----
ProcessEngineConfiguration.createProcessEngineConfigurationFromResourceDefault();
ProcessEngineConfiguration.createProcessEngineConfigurationFromResource(String resource);
ProcessEngineConfiguration.createProcessEngineConfigurationFromResource(String resource, String beanName);
ProcessEngineConfiguration.createProcessEngineConfigurationFromInputStream(InputStream inputStream);
ProcessEngineConfiguration.createProcessEngineConfigurationFromInputStream(InputStream inputStream, String beanName);
----


也可以不使用配置文件，基于默认创建配置（参考<<configurationClasses,不同的支持类>>获得更多信息）。

[source,java,linenums]
----
ProcessEngineConfiguration.createStandaloneProcessEngineConfiguration();
ProcessEngineConfiguration.createStandaloneInMemProcessEngineConfiguration();
----

所有的++ProcessEngineConfiguration.createXXX()++方法都返回++ProcessEngineConfiguration++，并可以继续按需调整。调用++buildProcessEngine()++后，生成一个++ProcessEngine++：

[source,java,linenums]
----
ProcessEngine processEngine = ProcessEngineConfiguration.createStandaloneInMemProcessEngineConfiguration()
  .setDatabaseSchemaUpdate(ProcessEngineConfiguration.DB_SCHEMA_UPDATE_FALSE)
  .setJdbcUrl("jdbc:h2:mem:my-own-db;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=1000")
  .setAsyncExecutorEnabled(true)
  .setAsyncExecutorActivate(false)
  .buildProcessEngine();
----



[[configurationRoot]]


=== ProcessEngineConfiguration bean


++activiti.cfg.xml++文件中必须包含一个id为$$'processEngineConfiguration'$$的bean。

[source,xml,linenums]
----
 <bean id="processEngineConfiguration" class="org.activiti.engine.impl.cfg.StandaloneProcessEngineConfiguration">
----


这个bean被用于构建++ProcessEngine++。有多个类可以用于定义++processEngineConfiguration++。这些类用于不同的环境，并各自设置一些默认值。最佳实践是选择（最）匹配你环境的类，以便减少配置引擎需要的参数。下面列出目前可以使用的类（后续版本会提供更多）：[[configurationClasses]]

* *org.activiti.engine.impl.cfg.StandaloneProcessEngineConfiguration*：流程引擎独立运行。Activiti自行处理事务。在默认情况下，数据库检查只在引擎启动时进行（如果Activiti表结构不存在或表结构版本不对，会抛出异常）。
* *org.activiti.engine.impl.cfg.StandaloneInMemProcessEngineConfiguration*：这是一个便于使用单元测试的类。Activiti自行处理事务。默认使用H2内存数据库。数据库会在引擎启动时创建，并在引擎关闭时删除。使用这个类时，很可能不需要更多的配置（除了使用任务执行器或邮件功能等时）。
* *org.activiti.spring.SpringProcessEngineConfiguration*：在流程引擎处于Spring环境时使用。查看<<springintegration,Spring集成章节>>获得更多信息。
* *org.activiti.engine.impl.cfg.JtaProcessEngineConfiguration*：用于引擎独立运行，并使用JTA事务的情况。


[[databaseConfiguration]]

=== 数据库配置


有两种方式配置Activiti引擎使用的数据库。第一种方式是定义数据库的JDBC参数：

* *jdbcUrl*: 数据库的JDBC URL。
* *jdbcDriver*: 特定数据库类型的驱动实现。
* *jdbcUsername*: 用于连接数据库的用户名。
* *jdbcPassword*: 用于连接数据库的密码。

通过提供的JDBC参数构造的数据源，使用默认的link:$$http://www.mybatis.org/$$[MyBatis]连接池设置。可用下列属性调整这个连接池（来自MyBatis文档）：

* *jdbcMaxActiveConnections*: 连接池能够容纳的最大活动连接数量。默认值为10.
* *jdbcMaxIdleConnections*: 连接池能够容纳的最大空闲连接数量。
* *jdbcMaxCheckoutTime*: 连接从连接池“取出”后，被强制返回前的最大时间间隔，单位为毫秒。默认值为20000（20秒）。
* *jdbcMaxWaitTime*: 这是一个底层设置，在连接池获取连接的时间异常长时，打印日志并尝试重新获取连接（避免连接池配置错误造成的永久沉默失败。默认值为20000（20秒）。

数据库配置示例：

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<property name="jdbcUrl" value="jdbc:h2:mem:activiti;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=1000" />
<property name="jdbcDriver" value="org.h2.Driver" />
<property name="jdbcUsername" value="sa" />
<property name="jdbcPassword" value="" />
----


也可以使用++javax.sql.DataSource++的实现（例如来自link:$$http://commons.apache.org/dbcp/$$[Apache Commons]的DBCP）：

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<bean id="dataSource" class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource" >
  <property name="driverClassName" value="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver" />
  <property name="url" value="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/activiti" />
  <property name="username" value="activiti" />
  <property name="password" value="activiti" />
  <property name="defaultAutoCommit" value="false" />
</bean>

<bean id="processEngineConfiguration" class="org.activiti.engine.impl.cfg.StandaloneProcessEngineConfiguration">

    <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource" />
    ...

----


请注意Activiti发布时不包括用于定义数据源的库。需要自行把库（例如来自DBCP）放在你的classpath中。

无论使用JDBC还是数据源方式配置，下列参数都可以使用：

* *databaseType*: 通常不需要特别设置这个参数，因为它可以从数据库连接信息中自动分析得出。只有在自动检测失败时才需要设置。可用值：{h2, mysql, oracle, postgres, mssql, db2}。**不使用默认的H2数据库时需要设置这个参数。**这个选项会决定创建、删除与查询时使用的脚本。查看<<supporteddatabases,“支持的数据库”章节>>了解我们支持哪些类型的数据库。
* *databaseSchemaUpdate*: 用于设置流程引擎启动关闭时使用的数据库表结构控制策略。
** +false+ (默认): 当引擎启动时，检查数据库表结构的版本是否匹配库文件版本。版本不匹配时抛出异常。
** ++true++: 构建引擎时，检查并在需要时更新表结构。表结构不存在则会创建。
** ++create-drop++: 引擎创建时创建表结构，并在引擎关闭时删除表结构。


[[jndiDatasourceConfig]]

=== JNDI数据源配置


By default, the database configuration for Activiti is contained within the db.properties files in the WEB-INF/classes of each web application. This isn't always ideal because it
requires users to either modify the db.properties in the Activiti source and recompile the war file, or explode the war and modify the db.properties on every deployment.

By using JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) to obtain the database connection, the connection is fully managed by the Servlet Container and the configuration can be managed outside the war deployment. This also allows more control over the connection parameters than what is provided by the db.properties file.


[[jndi_usage]]

==== Usage


To switch the Activiti Explorer and Activiti Rest web apps from db.properties configuration to JNDI datasource configuration, open the primary Spring configuration files (activiti-webapp-explorer2/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/activiti-standalone-context.xml and activiti-webapp-rest2/src/main/resources/activiti-context.xml), and delete the beans named "dbProperties" and "dataSource". Then, add the following bean:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<bean id="dataSource" class="org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean">
    <property name="jndiName" value="java:comp/env/jdbc/activitiDB"/>
</bean>

----

Next, we need to add context.xml files that contain the default H2 configuration. These will be overridden by your JNDI configuration, if it exists.  For Activiti Explorer, replace the file at activiti-webapp-explorer2/src/main/webapp/META-INF/context.xml with the following:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<Context antiJARLocking="true" path="/activiti-explorer2">
    <Resource auth="Container"
              name="jdbc/activitiDB"
              type="javax.sql.DataSource"
              scope="Shareable"
              description="JDBC DataSource"
              url="jdbc:h2:mem:activiti;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=1000"
              driverClassName="org.h2.Driver"
              username="sa"
              password=""
              defaultAutoCommit="false"
              initialSize="5"
              maxWait="5000"
              maxActive="120"
              maxIdle="5"/>
</Context>
----

For the Activiti REST webapp, add activiti-webapp-rest2/src/main/webapp/META-INF/context.xml containing the following:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Context antiJARLocking="true" path="/activiti-rest2">
    <Resource auth="Container"
              name="jdbc/activitiDB"
              type="javax.sql.DataSource"
              scope="Shareable"
              description="JDBC DataSource"
              url="jdbc:h2:mem:activiti;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1"
              driverClassName="org.h2.Driver"
              username="sa"
              password=""
              defaultAutoCommit="false"
              initialSize="5"
              maxWait="5000"
              maxActive="120"
              maxIdle="5"/>
</Context>
----

As an optional step, you can now delete the unused db.properties files in both the Activiti Explorer and Activiti REST webapp projects.


[[jndi_configuration]]

==== Configuration


Configuration of the JNDI datasource will differ depending on what servlet container application you are using. The instructions below will work for Tomcat, but for other container applications, please refer to the documentation for your container app.

If using Tomcat, the JNDI resource is configured within $CATALINA_BASE/conf/[enginename]/[hostname]/[warname].xml (for Activiti Explorer this will usually be $CATALINA_BASE/conf/Catalina/localhost/activiti-explorer.xml). The default context is copied from the Activiti war file when the application is first deployed, so if it already exists, you will need to replace it. To change the JNDI resource so that the application connects to MySQL instead of H2, for example, change the file to the following:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <Context antiJARLocking="true" path="/activiti-explorer2">
        <Resource auth="Container"
            name="jdbc/activitiDB"
            type="javax.sql.DataSource"
            description="JDBC DataSource"
            url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/activiti"
            driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
            username="sa"
            password=""
            defaultAutoCommit="false"
            initialSize="5"
            maxWait="5000"
            maxActive="120"
            maxIdle="5"/>
        </Context>
----


[[supporteddatabases]]


=== Supported databases

Listed below are the types (case sensitive!) that Activiti uses to refer to databases.

[[databaseTypes]]
[options="header"]
|===============
|Activiti database type|Example JDBC URL|Notes

|===============


[[creatingDatabaseTable]]

=== Creating the database tables

The easiest way to create the database tables for your database is to:

* Add the activiti-engine jars to your classpath
* Add a suitable database driver
* Add an Activiti configuration file (__activiti.cfg.xml__) to your classpath, pointing to your database (see <<databaseConfiguration,database configuration section>>)
* Execute the main method of the _DbSchemaCreate_ class

However, often only database administrators can execute DDL statements on a database. On a production system, this is also the wisest of choices. The SQL DDL statements can be found on the Activiti downloads page or inside the Activiti distribution folder, in the +database+ subdirectory. The scripts are also in the engine jar (__activiti-engine-x.jar__), in the package __org/activiti/db/create__ (the __drop__ folder contains the drop statements). The SQL files are of the form

----
activiti.{db}.{create|drop}.{type}.sql
----

Where __db__ is any of the <<supporteddatabases,supported databases>> and __type__ is

* *engine:* the tables needed for engine execution. Required.
* *identity:* the tables containing users, groups and memberships of users to groups. These tables are optional and should be used when using the default identity management as shipped with the engine.
* *history:* the tables that contain the history and audit information. Optional: not needed when history level is set to _none_. Note that this will also disable some features (such as commenting on tasks) which store the data in the history database.

*Note for MySQL users:* MySQL version lower than 5.6.4 has no support for timestamps or dates with millisecond precision. To make things even worse, some version will throw an exception when trying to create such a column but other versions don't. When doing auto-creation/upgrade, the engine will change the DDL when executing it. When using the DDL file approach, both a regular version and a special file with _mysql55_ in it are available (this applies on anything lower than 5.6.4). This latter file will have column types with no millisecond precision in it.

Concretely, the following applies for MySQL version

* *<5.6:* No millisecond precision available. DDL files available (look for files containing __mysql55__). Auto creation/update will work out of the box.
* *5.6.0 - 5.6.3:* No millisecond precision available. Auto creation/update will NOT work. It is advised to upgrade to a newer database version anyway. DDL files for _mysql 5.5_ could be used if really needed.
* *5.6.4+:* Millisecond precision available. DDL files available (default file containing __mysql__). Auto creation/update works out of the box.


Do note that in the case of upgrading the MySQL database later on and the Activiti tables are already created/upgraded, the column type change will have to be done manually!


[[database.tables.explained]]


=== Database table names explained

The database names of Activiti all start with *ACT_*. The second part is a two-character identification of the use case of the table. This use case will also roughly match the service API.

* *ACT_RE_**: 'RE' stands for +repository+. Tables with this prefix contain 'static' information such as process definitions and process resources (images, rules, etc.).
* *ACT_RU_**: 'RU' stands for +runtime+. These are the runtime tables that contain the runtime data of process instances, user tasks, variables, jobs, etc. Activiti only stores the runtime data during process instance execution, and removes the records when a process instance ends. This keeps the runtime tables small and fast.
* *ACT_ID_**: 'ID' stands for +identity+. These tables contain identity information, such as users, groups, etc.
* *ACT_HI_**: 'HI' stands for +history+. These are the tables that contain historic data, such as past process instances, variables, tasks, etc.
* *ACT_GE_**: +general+ data, which is used in various use cases.


[[databaseUpgrade]]


=== Database upgrade

Make sure you make a backup of your database (using your database backup capabilities) before you run an upgrade.


By default, a version check will be performed each time a process engine is created. This typically happens once at boot time of your application or of the Activiti webapps. If the Activiti library notices a difference between the library version and the version of the Activiti database tables, then an exception is thrown.


To upgrade, you have to start with putting the following configuration property in your activiti.cfg.xml configuration file:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<beans >

  <bean id="processEngineConfiguration" class="org.activiti.engine.impl.cfg.StandaloneProcessEngineConfiguration">
    <!-- ... -->
    <property name="databaseSchemaUpdate" value="true" />
    <!-- ... -->
  </bean>

</beans>
----

*Also, include a suitable database driver for your database to the classpath.* Upgrade the Activiti libraries in your application. Or start up a new version of Activiti and point it to a database that contains an older version.  With +databaseSchemaUpdate+ set to +true+, Activiti will automatically upgrade the DB schema to the newer version the first time when it notices that libraries and DB schema are out of sync.

*As an alternative you can also run the upgrade DDL statements.* It's also possible to run the upgrade database scripts, available on the Activiti downloads page.

[[jobExecutorConfiguration]]

=== Job Executor and Async Executor (since version 5.17.0)

Starting from version 5.17.0 Activiti provides an Async executor in addition to the Job Executor. The Async executor is a more performant and more database friendly way of executing asynchronous jobs in the Activiti Engine.
It's therefore recommended to switch to the Async executor. By default the old job executor is still used. More information can be found in the advanced section of the user guide.

Moreover, if running under Java EE 7, JSR-236 compliant +ManagedJobExecutor+ and +ManagedAsyncJobExecutor+ can be used for letting the container manage the threads. In order to enable them, the thread factory should be passed in the configuration as follows:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<bean id="threadFactory" class="org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean">
   <property name="jndiName" value="java:jboss/ee/concurrency/factory/default" />
</bean>

<bean id="customJobExecutor" class="org.activiti.engine.impl.jobexecutor.ManagedJobExecutor">
   <!-- ... -->
   <property name="threadFactory" ref="threadFactory" />
   <!-- ... -->
</bean>
----

Both managed implementations fall back to their default counterparts if the thread factory is not specified.

=== Job executor activation

The +JobExecutor+ is a component that manages a couple of threads to fire timers (and later also asynchronous messages). For unit testing scenarios, it is cumbersome to work with multiple threads. Therefore the API allows to query for (++ManagementService.createJobQuery++) and execute jobs (++ManagementService.executeJob++) through the API so that job execution can be controlled from within a unit test.  To avoid interference by the job executor, it can be turned off.

By default, the +JobExecutor+ is activated when the process engine boots. Specify

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<property name="jobExecutorActivate" value="false" />
----

when you don't want the +JobExecutor+ to be activated upon booting the process engine.

=== Async executor activation

The +AsyncExecutor+ is a component that manages a thread pool to fire timers and other asynchronous tasks.

By default, the +AsyncExecutor+ is not enabled and the JobExecutor is used due to legacy reasons. It's however recommended to use the new AsyncExecutor instead.
This can be done by defining two properties

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<property name="asyncExecutorEnabled" value="true" />
<property name="asyncExecutorActivate" value="true" />
----

The asyncExecutorEnabled property is to enable the Async executor instead of the old Job executor.
The second property asyncExecutorActivate instructs the Activiti Engine to startup the Async executor thread pool at startup. 

[[mailServerConfiguration]]


=== Mail server configuration

Configuring a mail server is optional. Activiti supports sending e-mails in business processes. To actually send an e-mail, a valid SMTP mail server configuration is required. See the <<bpmnEmailTaskServerConfiguration,e-mail task>> for the configuration options.


[[historyConfiguration]]


=== History configuration

Customizing the configuration of history storage is optional. This allows you to tweak settings that influence the <<history,history capabilities>> of the engine. See <<historyConfig,history configuration>> for more details.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<property name="history" value="audit" />
----


[[exposingConfigurationBeans]]


=== Exposing configuration beans in expressions and scripts

By default, all beans that you specify in the +activiti.cfg.xml+ configuration or in your own Spring configuration file are available to expressions and in the scripts. If you want to limit the visibility of beans in your configuration file, you can configure a property called +beans+ in your process engine configuration. The beans property in +ProcessEngineConfiguration+ is a map. When you specify that property, only beans specified in that map will be visible to expressions and scripts.  The exposed beans will be exposed with the names as you specify in that map.


[[processDefinitionCacheConfiguration]]


=== Deployment cache configuration

All process definition are cached (after they're parsed) to avoid hitting the database every time a process definition is needed and because process definition data doesn't change. By default, there is no limit on this cache. To limit the process definition cache, add following property

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<property name="processDefinitionCacheLimit" value="10" />
----


Setting this property will swap the default hashmap cache with a LRU cache that has the provided hard limit. Of course, the 'best' value of this property depends on the total amount of process definitions stored and the number of process definitions actually used at runtime by all the runtime process instances.

You can also inject your own cache implementation. This must be a bean that implements the org.activiti.engine.impl.persistence.deploy.DeploymentCache interface:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<property name="processDefinitionCache">
  <bean class="org.activiti.MyCache" />
</property>
----


There is a similar property called +knowledgeBaseCacheLimit+ and +knowledgeBaseCache+ for configuring the rules cache. This is only needed when you use the rules task in your processes.


[[loggingConfiguration]]


=== Logging

As of Activiti 5.12, SLF4J is used as logging framework, replacing the previous used java.util.logging. All logging (activiti, spring, mybatis, ...) is routed through SLF4J and allows for selecting the logging-implementation of your choice.

*By default no SFL4J-binding jar is present in the activiti-engine dependencies, this should be added in your project in order to use the logging framework of your choice.* If no implementation jar is added, SLF4J will use a NOP-logger, not logging anything at all, other than a warning that nothing will be logged. For more info on these bindings link:$$http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder$$[http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder].

With Maven, add for example a dependency like this (here using log4j), note that you still need to add a version:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>slf4j-log4j12</artifactId>
</dependency>
----


The activiti-explorer and activiti-rest webapps are configured to use Log4j-binding. Log4j is also used when running the tests for all the activiti-* modules.


*Important note when using a container with commons-logging in the classpath:* In order to route the spring-logging through SLF4J, a bridge is used (see link:$$http://www.slf4j.org/legacy.html#jclOverSLF4J$$[http://www.slf4j.org/legacy.html#jclOverSLF4J]). If your container provides a commons-logging implementation, please follow directions on this page: link:$$http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#release$$[http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#release] to ensure stability.

Example when using Maven (version omitted):

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>jcl-over-slf4j</artifactId>
</dependency>
----


[[MDC]]


=== Mapped Diagnostic Contexts


As of version 5.13, Activiti supports Mapped Diagnostic Contexts feature of sl4j. These basic information are passed to the underlying logger along with what is going to be logged:

* processDefinition Id as mdcProcessDefinitionID
* processInstance Id as mdcProcessInstanceID
* execution Id as mdcExecutionId

None of these information are logged by default. The logger can be configured to show them in desired format, extra to the usual logged messages. For example in log4j the following sample layout definition  causes the logger to show the above mentioned information:

[source,properties,linenums]
----
 log4j.appender.consoleAppender.layout.ConversionPattern=ProcessDefinitionId=%X{mdcProcessDefinitionID} executionId=%X{mdcExecutionId} mdcProcessInstanceID=%X{mdcProcessInstanceID} mdcBusinessKey=%X{mdcBusinessKey} %m%n
----

This is useful where the systems are mission critical and logs should be seriously checked,  by means of a log analyzer for example.


[[eventDispatcher]]


=== Event handlers

An event mechanism has been introduced in Activiti 5.15. It allows you to get notified when various events occur within the engine. Take a look at <<eventDispatcherEventTypes,all supported event types>> for an overview of the events available.

It's possible to register a listener for certain types of events as opposed to getting notified when any type of event is dispatched. You can either add engine-wide event listeners <<eventDispatcherConfiguration,through the configuration>>, add engine-wide event listeners <<eventDispatcherConfigurationRuntime,at runtime using the API>> or add event-listeners to <<eventDispatcherConfigurationProcessDefinition,specific process definitions in the BPMN XML>>.


All events dispatched are a subtype of +org.activiti.engine.delegate.event.ActivitiEvent+. The event exposes (if available) the +type+, +executionId+, +processInstanceId+ and +processDefinitionId+. Certain events contain additional context related to the event that occurred, additional information about additional payload can be found in the list of <<eventDispatcherEventTypes,all supported event types>>.

[[eventDispatcherListener]]


==== Event listener implementation

The only requirement an event-listener has, is to implement +org.activiti.engine.delegate.event.ActivitiEventListener+. Below is an example implementation of a listener, which outputs all events received to the standard-out, with exception of events related to job-execution:

[source,java,linenums]
----
public class MyEventListener implements ActivitiEventListener {

  @Override
  public void onEvent(ActivitiEvent event) {
    switch (event.getType()) {

      case JOB_EXECUTION_SUCCESS:
        System.out.println("A job well done!");
        break;

      case JOB_EXECUTION_FAILURE:
        System.out.println("A job has failed...");
        break;

      default:
        System.out.println("Event received: " + event.getType());
    }
  }

  @Override
  public boolean isFailOnException() {
    // The logic in the onEvent method of this listener is not critical, exceptions
    // can be ignored if logging fails...
    return false;
  }
}
----


The +isFailOnException()+ method determines the behaviour in case the +onEvent(..)+ method throws an exception when an event is dispatched. In case +false+ is returned, the exception is ignored. When +true+ is returned, the exception is not ignored and bubbles up, effectively failing the current ongoing command. In case the event was part of an API-call (or any other transactional operation, e.g. job-execution), the transaction will be rolled back. In case the behaviour in the event-listener is not business-critical, it's recommended to return +false+.

There are a few base implementations provided by Activiti to facilitate common use cases of event-listeners. These can be used as base-class or as an example listener implementation:

* *org.activiti.engine.delegate.event.BaseEntityEventListener*: An event-listener base-class that can be used to listen for entity-related events for a specific type of entity or for all entities. It hides away the type-checking and offers 4 methods that should be overridden: +onCreate(..)+, +onUpdate(..)+ and +onDelete(..)+ when an entity is created, updated or deleted. For all other entity-related events, the ++onEntityEvent(..) ++is called.



[[eventDispatcherConfiguration]]


==== Configuration and setup

If an event-listener is configured in the process engine configuration, it will be active when the process engine starts and will remain active after subsequent reboots of the engine.

The property +eventListeners+ expects a list of +org.activiti.engine.delegate.event.ActivitiEventListener+ instances. As usual, you can either declare an inline bean definition or use a +ref+ to an existing bean instead. The snippet below adds an event-listener to the configuration that is notified when any event is dispatched, regardless of its type:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<bean id="processEngineConfiguration" class="org.activiti.engine.impl.cfg.StandaloneProcessEngineConfiguration">
    ...
    <property name="eventListeners">
      <list>
         <bean class="org.activiti.engine.example.MyEventListener" />
      </list>
    </property>
</bean>
----

To get notified when certain types of events get dispatched, use the +typedEventListeners+ property, which expects a map. The key of a map-entry is a comma-separated list of event-names (or a single event-name). The value of a map-entry is a list of +org.activiti.engine.delegate.event.ActivitiEventListener+ instances. The snippet below adds an event-listener to the configuration, that is notified when a job execution was successful or failed:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<bean id="processEngineConfiguration" class="org.activiti.engine.impl.cfg.StandaloneProcessEngineConfiguration">
    ...
    <property name="typedEventListeners">
      <map>
        <entry key="JOB_EXECUTION_SUCCESS,JOB_EXECUTION_FAILURE" >
          <list>
            <bean class="org.activiti.engine.example.MyJobEventListener" />
          </list>
        </entry>
      </map>
    </property>
</bean>
----


The order of dispatching events is determined on the order the listeners were added. First, all normal event-listeners are called (++eventListeners++ property) in the order they are defined in the ++list++. After that, all typed event listeners (++typedEventListeners++ properties) are called, if an event of the right type is dispatched.


[[eventDispatcherConfigurationRuntime]]

==== Adding listeners at runtime

It's possible to add and remove additional event-listeners to the engine by using the API (++RuntimeService++):

[source,java,linenums]
----

/**
 * Adds an event-listener which will be notified of ALL events by the dispatcher.
 * @param listenerToAdd the listener to add
 */
void addEventListener(ActivitiEventListener listenerToAdd);

/**
 * Adds an event-listener which will only be notified when an event occurs, which type is in the given types.
 * @param listenerToAdd the listener to add
 * @param types types of events the listener should be notified for
 */
void addEventListener(ActivitiEventListener listenerToAdd, ActivitiEventType... types);

/**
 * Removes the given listener from this dispatcher. The listener will no longer be notified,
 * regardless of the type(s) it was registered for in the first place.
 * @param listenerToRemove listener to remove
 */
 void removeEventListener(ActivitiEventListener listenerToRemove);
----

Please note that the listeners added at runtime *are not retained when the engine is rebooted.*


[[eventDispatcherConfigurationProcessDefinition]]


==== Adding listeners to process definitions

It's possible to add listeners to a specific process-definition. The listeners will only be called for events related to the process definition and to all events related to process instances that are started with that specific process definition. The listener implementations can be defined using a fully qualified classname, an expression that resolves to a bean that implements the listener interface or can be configured to throw a message/signal/error BPMN event.


===== Listeners executing user-defined logic

The snippet below adds 2 listeners to a process-definition. The first listener will receive events of any type, with a listener implementation based on a fully-qualified class name. The second listener is only notified when a job is successfully executed or when it failed, using a listener that has been defined in the +beans+ property of the process engine configuration.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<process id="testEventListeners">
  <extensionElements>
    <activiti:eventListener class="org.activiti.engine.test.MyEventListener" />
    <activiti:eventListener delegateExpression="${testEventListener}" events="JOB_EXECUTION_SUCCESS,JOB_EXECUTION_FAILURE" />
  </extensionElements>

  ...

</process>
----

For events related to entities, it's also possible to add listeners to a process-definition that get only notified when entity-events occur for a certain entity type. The snippet below shows how this can be achieved. It can be used along for ALL entity-events (first example) or for specific event types only (second example).

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<process id="testEventListeners">
  <extensionElements>
    <activiti:eventListener class="org.activiti.engine.test.MyEventListener" entityType="task" />
    <activiti:eventListener delegateExpression="${testEventListener}" events="ENTITY_CREATED" entityType="task" />
  </extensionElements>

  ...

</process>
----

Supported values for the +entityType+ are: +attachment+, +comment+, +execution+, ++identity-link++, ++job++, ++process-instance++, ++process-definition++, ++task++.



===== Listeners throwing BPMN events

<<experimental, [EXPERIMENTAL] >>


Another way of handling events being dispatched is to throw a BPMN event. Please bear in mind that it only makes sense to throw BPMN-events with certain kinds of Activiti event types. For example, throwing a BPMN event when the process-instance is deleted will result in an error. The snippet below shows how to throw a signal inside process-instance, throw a signal to an external process (global), throw a message-event inside the process-instance and throw an error-event inside the process-instance. Instead of using the +class+ or +delegateExpression+, the attribute +throwEvent+ is used, along with an additional attribute, specific to the type of event being thrown.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<process id="testEventListeners">
  <extensionElements>
    <activiti:eventListener throwEvent="signal" signalName="My signal" events="TASK_ASSIGNED" />
  </extensionElements>
</process>
----

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<process id="testEventListeners">
  <extensionElements>
    <activiti:eventListener throwEvent="globalSignal" signalName="My signal" events="TASK_ASSIGNED" />
  </extensionElements>
</process>
----


[source,xml,linenums]
----
<process id="testEventListeners">
  <extensionElements>
    <activiti:eventListener throwEvent="message" messageName="My message" events="TASK_ASSIGNED" />
  </extensionElements>
</process>
----

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<process id="testEventListeners">
  <extensionElements>
    <activiti:eventListener throwEvent="error" errorCode="123" events="TASK_ASSIGNED" />
  </extensionElements>
</process>
----

If additional logic is needed to decide whether or not to throw the BPMN-event, it's possible to extend the listener-classes provided by Activiti. By overriding the +isValidEvent(ActivitiEvent event) in your subclass, the BPMN-event throwing can be prevented. The classes involved are +org.activiti.engine.test.api.event.SignalThrowingEventListenerTest+, +org.activiti.engine.impl.bpmn.helper.MessageThrowingEventListener+ and +org.activiti.engine.impl.bpmn.helper.ErrorThrowingEventListener+.


===== Notes on listeners on a process-definition

* Event-listeners can only be declared on the +process+ element, as a child-element of the +extensionElements+. Listeners cannot be defined on individual activities in the process.
* Expressions used in the +delegateExpression+ do not have access to the execution-context, as other expressions (e.g. in gateways) have. They can only reference beans defined in the +beans+ property of the process engine configuration or when using spring (and the beans property is absent) to any spring-bean that implements the listener interface.
* When using the +class+ attribute of a listener, there will only be a single instance of that class created. Make sure the listener implementations do not rely on member-fields or ensure safe usage from multiple threads/contexts.
* When an illegal event-type is used in the +events+ attribute or illegal +throwEvent+ value is used, an exception will be thrown when the process-definition is deployed (effectively failing the deployment). When an illegal value for +class+ or +delegateExecution+ is supplied (either a nonexistent class, a nonexistent bean reference or a delegate not implementing listener interface), an exception will be thrown when the process is started (or when the first valid event for that process-definition is dispatched to the listener). Make sure the referenced classes are on the classpath and that the expressions resolve to a valid instance.


[[eventDispatcherCustomEvents]]

==== Dispatching events through API

We opened up the event-dispatching mechanism through the API, to allow you to dispatch custom events to any listeners that are registered in the engine. It's recommended (although not enforced) to only dispatch +ActivitiEvents+ with type +CUSTOM+. Dispatching the event can be done using the ++RuntimeService++:

[source,java,linenums]
----

/**
 * Dispatches the given event to any listeners that are registered.
 * @param event event to dispatch.
 *
 * @throws ActivitiException if an exception occurs when dispatching the event or when the {@link ActivitiEventDispatcher}
 * is disabled.
 * @throws ActivitiIllegalArgumentException when the given event is not suitable for dispatching.
 */
 void dispatchEvent(ActivitiEvent event);
----

[[eventDispatcherEventTypes]]


==== Supported event types

Listed below are all event types that can occur in the engine. Each type corresponds to an enum value in the +org.activiti.engine.delegate.event.ActivitiEventType+.

[[eventDispatcherRemarks]]


==== Additional remarks


*Only listeners are notified in the engine the events are dispatched from.* So in case you have different engines - running against the same database - only events that originated in the engine the listener is registered for, are dispatched to that listener. The events that occur in the other engine are not dispatched to the listeners, regardless of the fact they are running in the same JVM or not.

Certain event-types (related to entities) expose the targeted entity. Depending on the type or event, these entities cannot be updated anymore (e.g. when the entity is deleted). If possible, use the +EngineServices+ exposed by the event to interact in a safe way with the engine. Even then, you need to be cautious with updates/operations on entities that are involved in the dispatched event.

No entity-events are dispatched related to history, as they all have a runtime-counterpart which have their events dispatched.
